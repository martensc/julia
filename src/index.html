            <p>Now is the time. We have to demonstrate and encourage acceptance and multicultural understanding for our youth. With these conversations, education, and support, our children will have a safer, more inclusive community. To create and hold the space for this to happen, we must start by having these conversations.</p>
            <p>In viewing District 622â€™s mission and strategic plan, I found many of my own personal values--inclusion, diversity, continuous learning, family, community, and partnerships. Like the district, at the core of my mission is engaging and empowering students, staff, and the community. With your support, I am ready to stand up for these values on the District 622 School Board.</p>
